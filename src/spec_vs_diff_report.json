  "summary": "REQ-4 and REQ-5 appear implemented via a logo-click password dialog + sessionStorage-based unlock state, with Admin Panel gated by both backend admin check and unlock state. REQ-6 cannot be confirmed from the provided backend diff truncation (no visible delete update method or fetch filtering change). REQ-7 long-press state/handlers and delete mutation exist, but the actual conditional delete action rendering is truncated and cannot be fully verified.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-6",
      "requirement": "Implement backend support for deleting a global chat message via a new update method that deletes by messageId (only sender, optionally admin), and ensure deleted messages are removed from fetchGlobalMessages results.",
      "reason": "The diff shows new state for deletedMessageIds and a migration, but does not show any new public/shared update method (e.g., deleteGlobalMessage) nor changes to fetchGlobalMessages to filter out deleted messages; backend/main.mo is truncated before any such implementation is visible.",

      "id": "REQ-7",
      "requirement": "On long-press of an own message, reveal a delete icon/action for that message (messages from others must not show delete).",
      "reason": "MessageList.tsx shows long-press detection state (longPressMessageId) and computes showDeleteButton, but the render section where the delete icon/action would be conditionally displayed is truncated, so the UI reveal behavior cannot be verified from the provided diff summary.",

      "description": "Added URL parameter/sessionStorage helper utilities (getUrlParameter/getPersistedUrlParameter/etc.).",
